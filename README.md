MY FINAL YEAR PROJECT "DETECTORS": DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF STATIC ANALYSIS TOOL FOR SOLIDITY SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITIES USING JAVASCRIPT.
My tool provides an efficient way to automatically detect and correct critical vulnerabilities like Reentrancy, Integer Overflows/Underflows, and DoS in Solidity smart contracts.

My Tool Can Do:-
Reentrancy is handled by inserting a locking modifier, Integer bugs are fixed using Solidityâ€™s unchecked {} syntax for safety , DoS risks are not auto inline warnings fixed but clearly flagged with.
